# Advent of Code 2024

This repository hosts my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

Currently WIP with the following items on my TODO
- [ ] Make input parsing once and for all bearable with scnlib
- [ ] Determine a better approach for running solutions, benchmarking and generating new days
- [ ] Clean up Day 1, Day 2 (and probably everything until Day 6)
